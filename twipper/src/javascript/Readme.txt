This directory is for supporting js files.

debug.js - some helper functions I use for debugging (a simpler time, before fancy mojo-log and such)
utility.js - first forays into durable objects widget()s are interesting and I like to use them
dbhelper.js - the DB helper objects I've been pushing for so long ;)  very experimental, depends on utility.js
base64.js - downloaded from somewhere to provide base64 en/decoding
